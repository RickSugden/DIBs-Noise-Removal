# Removal of Atmospheric noise from Diffuse Interstellar Band Spectroscopy Data

This is my first-year undergraduate summer project in astronomy under Dr. Jan Cami. 

My role was to curate a dataset of molecular cross section spectra and use them to estimate the intereference caused by different atmospheric gases in a ground based telescope's spectroscopy.

As a first-year student, I learned a lot of basics like how python works, and got practice with data science packages as well as astropy.
