# Removal of Atmospheric noise from Diffuse Interstellar Band Spectroscopy Data

This is my first-year undergraduate summer project studying the astronomy of DIBs under Dr. Jan Cami. 

A DIB is a broadened spectroscopic absorption feature that originates from molecules in the interstellar medium.

My role was to curate a dataset of molecular cross section spectra and use them to estimate the intereference caused by different atmospheric gases in a ground based telescope's spectroscopy. 

As a first-year student, I learned the basics of python and matlab, research fundamentals, and got practice with data science packages as well as astropy.

Before processing the spectral data looks very similar to known noise patterns:

Remove known intereference like Ozone (O3):

Remove blockers that I suspected:
